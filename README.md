# Sudoku

Course: Fundamentals of Programming (FOP)

This project is a Sudoku game developed in C++ as part of the Fundamentals of Programming course. Using core programming concepts, I implemented the following functionalities:

Create Puzzle: Allows the user to manually set up a Sudoku puzzle.
Solve Puzzle: Enables the user to solve the puzzle with validation checks.
Auto Solve Puzzle: Automatically provides a solution to any given puzzle configuration.
This project demonstrates my foundational skills in C++ programming and problem-solving.
