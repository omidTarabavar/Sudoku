Project Name: Sudoku
Course: Fundamentals of Programming (FOP)

This project is a Sudoku game developed in C++ as part of the Fundamentals of Programming course. Leveraging core programming concepts, I implemented key functionalities that enhance the gameplay experience:

Create Puzzle: Generates a new, randomized Sudoku puzzle for the player.
Solve Puzzle: Allows players to input solutions, with validation checks.
Auto Solve Puzzle: Automatically solves any given puzzle, providing instant solutions.
This project showcases my understanding of programming fundamentals and problem-solving in C++.
